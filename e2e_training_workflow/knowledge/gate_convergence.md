# The correctness gate: L0 + L1 (L2 is opt-in)

Inference gates on byte-identical output. Training has no output, and its failure mode is slower and
nastier: a wrong backward, a systematically biased kernel, or an overlay that engaged on only SOME
ranks looks healthy for tens of steps and destroys convergence thousands of steps later.

## L0 — op level (`scripts/l0_gate.py`)
The oracle covers `out`, **`dgrad` and `wgrad`** against an INDEPENDENT fp32 reference (not a replay
of the fused op — the captured call carries runtime handles that cannot be rebuilt offline).

**No hand-picked tolerance.** "Is rtol=1e-2 ok?" has no defensible answer. Instead the capture
records the error the ORIGINAL implementation already carries against the fp32 reference, and a
candidate is acceptable iff it is **no further from the reference than the original is** (x1.25).
Nothing to argue about, and no penalty for rounding the baseline also does.

**Check the sign distribution, not only the magnitude.** A small systematic bias passes every
magnitude check and still destroys convergence. Measured baseline profile on TE `_LayerNormLinear`:
`out` rel 0.196%, sign_balance 0.489 — unbiased, as a healthy bf16 op should be.

**Backward is currently ADVISORY, not enforceable.** Measured `rel_mean_abs` > 1.0 on `dgrad` /
`wgrad` means the captured tensors and a single-call reference are not the same quantity — most
likely `gradient_accumulation_fusion` writing into `main_grad`, and/or a reduction. The sign balances
(0.48-0.50) show no systematic bias, so this is a comparability problem, not a correctness one. Until
the isolated gradient contribution is captured, weight the sign test over the magnitude test on the
backward, and say in the report which half of L0 was enforceable.

## L1 — trajectory level (`scripts/trajectory_gate.py`)
**Training is chaotic. This is measured, not theoretical.** Two runs at identical config on identical
data (useful-token sequences match step for step) still diverge:

| step | loss delta | grad_norm delta |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **0.0 — bit-identical** | **0.87%** |
| 5 | 0.76% | 22.7% |
| 12 | 4.40% | 40.2% |
| 21 | **2.04 absolute** (loss is ~3) | — |

Two consequences:

1. **A scalar aggregate over a long window is the wrong instrument.** Calibrating `max |dloss|` over
   25 steps yields a limit of **6.1 on a loss of 3** — a gate that passes any bug. The band must be a
   **function of step index**: the candidate's drift at step i against how far a baseline PAIR had
   drifted by that same step.
2. **Step 1 is the sharpest instrument available** — a pure forward on identical weights, so its loss
   is bit-reproducible: a zero-noise probe of the forward path. `grad_norm` at step 1 is NOT
   reproducible (0.87%, backward atomics / reduction order), so backward nondeterminism is calibrated
   rather than assumed away.

Three independent detectors:
- **step-1 forward probe** — zero natural noise.
- **per-step envelope** — fails on a *pattern* of exceedances, not one chaotic step.
- **early-window sign balance** — a one-sided delta is a systematic bias even when every magnitude
  check passes (same doctrine as the L0 sign rule).

Validated against a synthetic +0.3% systematic loss bias: all three fire, while the real baseline
pair passes.

**The band is measured, never assumed.** `trajectory_gate.py calibrate` needs >= 2 independent
baseline runs at identical config. Re-calibrate per workload: divergence rates differ with model
size and parallel mapping.

**Known gap.** The step-1 floor (0.05% relative) is a policy guess, not a calibration: a baseline
pair runs identical kernels, so its step-1 delta is exactly 0 and provides no floor. A legitimate
kernel swap perturbs rounding; calibrating this needs a pair of known-equivalent kernel backends.
Until then, treat a step-1 failure on a kernel swap as "investigate", not as proof of a bug.

## L2 — soak
Opt-in, plus auto-triggered for high-risk classes: anything touching backward, the optimizer, a
reduction order, or precision/scaling. Not in the default per-candidate path.

## What can accept, and what can only reject
L0 and L1 can **only reject**. Acceptance requires a throughput delta above the measured band. A
throughput-neutral, memory-saving change is **banked, not accepted** — memory is a currency that only
ConfigSweep (deep mode) can spend.
